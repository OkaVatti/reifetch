# reifetch

**Reifetch** is a work in progress successor to neofetch, made exclusivly for Linux, BSD, and MacOS systems. It's mission is to be faster, lightweight, and way more user friendly. The goal of neofetch is to give it's users a better experience than neofetch. This goal is achieved by trashing all of the useless, obscure distro asciis, keeping some of the most popular options, and getting rid of all windows, ios/ipados, and old UNIX compatabilities. As well as cleaning up the config file and making some of the options a lot easier to access.

 
 ## How to install
 
Installation is relativly simple and straight forward

**1.** clone the repo to your home directory.
```
git clone 
```
